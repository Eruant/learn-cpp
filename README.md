Teaching myself c++ from [learncpp.com](http://www.learncpp.com/)

Compile with `g++` followed by the files to include `main.cpp` and an output file `-o myApp`. You can also specify a directory of includes `-I /src/includes`

```shell
g++ main.cpp another.css -o myApp
```

Compile with `g++ -o <program> <source>`
